# sTablr: Quick Summary Statisics in R
A set of two major R functions to: (1) perform statistical analysis on a given dataframe using a pre-specified grouping variable; and (2) generate tables using a combination of ``knitr::kable`` and ``flextable``.

Trivia: While the name ``sTablr`` is meant to indicate that this is a statistics table utility in R, it was also chosen as an intentional nod to Hall of Fame NFL quarterback Ken Stabler.
